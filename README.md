# Permission-calculator-for-discord-bots
The Permission Analyzer is a Node.js script that performs a static analysis of your codebase. It scans your files for specific discord.js method calls that are gated by a permission (e.g., .ban(), .kick(), .setName()) and generates a complete, auditable report of its findings.
